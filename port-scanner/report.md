# Project Title — Short descriptive subtitle

**Role:** Personal lab / SOC exercise / cloud audit

**Date:** 2025-09-15

**Tools:** Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark, Metasploit, Splunk (list the main tools)

**Difficulty:** Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced

---

## Executive summary (2–4 sentences)

Brief statement for non-technical readers: what you tested, primary finding, business impact, and whether systems were exploited in a lab.

---

## Scope & Objective

- Scope: (e.g., `10.0.2.15` VM lab only, owned test environment)
- Objective: (e.g., enumerate services and demonstrate a privilege escalation path)

---

## Environment / Setup

- Host OS: Kali Linux 2025.x (attacker)
- Target: Metasploitable2 / Windows Server 2019 (describe version)
- Steps to reproduce (short): VM snapshots, any custom configs

---

## Methodology & Steps (command-first, reproducible)

1. **Reconnaissance**
    - Command: `nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/basic 10.0.2.15`
    - Output: brief summary (open ports: 22/80/445)
2. **Service enumeration**
    - Commands, tools, and short output snippets (or provide `nmap` XML file link)
3. **Exploitation**
    - Exact exploit used, payload, commands. Include screenshots and proof (e.g., `id`, `whoami`).
4. **Privilege escalation**
    - Commands like `linpeas.sh` output snippet and final `sudo -l` or `whoami` result.
5. **Post-exploitation (lab-only)**
    - Short summary: no persistence in public repos; only explain concepts.

---

## Findings (bulleted)

- Vulnerability 1: description, CVE (if any), exploitability, CVSS (if known)
- Vulnerability 2: …

---

## Business impact & Severity

Explain in plain language why it’s bad (data exfiltration, lateral movement, RCE), map to confidentiality/integrity/availability.

---

## Mitigation & Remediation (actionable)

1. Patch X (version Y)
2. Disable service or change config with exact commands or settings
3. Apply firewall rules: `ufw deny 445/tcp` (example)

---

## Artifacts

- `screenshots/` (names and short captions)
- Logs: `nmap/basic.xml`, `capture.pcap` (sanitized)
- Scripts: `enumerate.sh`

---

## Lessons learned / Next steps

What you would test next, and how this informed your learning.

---

## Short resume line

One sentence summarizing the skill and result (copyable for CV).
